# Search Engine

Beginning of a fully modular search engine.

## Compiling and Running

In the root directory execute the following to create the CMake files:

`cmake -S . -B out/build`

Afterwards, go into the `out/build` directory you execute the `make` command, which will compile the project.

Now you can run the search engine by simply running:

`./searchengine`

```
cmake -S . -B out/build
cd out/build
make
./searchengine
```
