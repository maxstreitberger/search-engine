# Executable

There are two executables available: **OnTheFlyWeb** and **OnTheFlyDocumentSearch**. Both are used in the same way; the only difference is where the search engine searches. The `Web` ending indicates that the search engine searches through a web page, whereas the `Document` ending shows that the search engine searches through a particular folder.

## Installation

To run the executables, you have first to install the library. You can find the installation guide [here](library.md#library-installation).

## Usage

```
$ OnTheFlyWebSearch -p [url] -s [search_term]
```
