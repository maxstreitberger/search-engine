# Executable

There are two executables available: **onTheFlyWeb** and **onTheFlyDocument**. Both are used in the same way; the only difference is where the search engine searches. The `Web` ending indicates that the search engine searches through a web page, whereas the `Document` ending shows that the search engine searches through a particular folder.

## Installation

1. Download and extract package
2. Add path to environment variables. Guide for [Windows](https://medium.com/@kevinmarkvi/how-to-add-executables-to-your-path-in-windows-5ffa4ce61a53), [Linux](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux), and [MacOS](https://www.architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/).

## Usage

```
$ ./onTheFlyWeb -p [url] -s [search_term] -m [max_items] -d [search_depth]
```
